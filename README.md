## What do you need to make this work?

Required:

## Getting started

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following commands. (If you have them installed, these commands return a version number; if not, the commands aren't recognized.)
```bash
git --version
npm -v
```
2. Install the [NR1 CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [the developer center](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher), and following the instructions to install and set up your New Relic development environment. This should take about 5 minutes.
3. Execute the following command to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data:

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-openstack.git
cd nr1-openstack
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```
